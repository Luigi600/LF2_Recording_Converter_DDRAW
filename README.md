# lf2-ai-scriptengine
Modified clone of zort's fork of the ddraw wrapper.
Nothing really changed. I only build the angelscript SDK to get the angelscript.lib, and get the missing angelscript.h from angelscript SDK.

I hope this simplifies building the ddraw wrapper and helps maintaining the development of this DLL and keeping Little Fighter 2 alive.
WRITTING AIs for LF2 is just FUN!

Sorry if I didn't do this by 'fork' or anything. I'm just not used to it. Let me know if i violate anything.
Thank you
